## About Us

RLadies Amherst is a group that promotes gender inclusivity in statistics and data science at [Amherst](https://www.amherst.edu/). We are part of the world-wide [RLadies](https://rladies.org) organization that promotes gender diversity in the R community.  We will be holding multiple events throughout the semester, including speakers, panels, and more. All are welcome to attend these events, regardless of gender identity!
